## My first hands-on coding experience

As inventor of C++ language, Bjarne Stroustrup, states in his book "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++" [1]

For contrast, it may be useful for you to see a list of (severely abbreviated) characterizations of approaches that we decided not to take:
• “C first”: This approach to learning C++ is wasteful of students’ time and leads to poor programming practices by forcing students to approach problems with fewer facilities, techniques, and libraries than necessary. C++ provides stronger type checking than C, a standard library with better support for novices, and exceptions for error handling.

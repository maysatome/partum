## My first hands-on coding experience

As inventor of C++ language, Bjarne Stroustrup, states in his book "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++" [1]

For contrast, it may be useful for you to see a list of (severely abbreviated) characterizations of approaches that we decided not to take:
• “C first”: This approach to learning C++ is wasteful of students’ time and leads to poor programming practices by forcing students to approach problems with fewer facilities, techniques, and libraries than necessary. C++ provides stronger type checking than C, a standard library with better support for novices, and exceptions for error handling.

I will illustrate the solution for next list of problems:

Lista de exercícios – Estrutura seqüencial
1. Faça um programa que receba quatro números inteiros, calcule e mostre a soma desses
números.
2. Faça um programa que receba três notas, calcule e mostre a média aritmética entre elas.
3. Faça um programa que receba três notas e seus respectivos pesos, calcule e mostre a média
ponderada.
4. Faça um programa que receba o salário de um funcionário, calcule e mostre o novo salário,
sabendo-se que este sofreu um aumento de 25%.
5. Faça um programa que receba o salário de um funcionário e o percentual de aumento, calcule e
mostre o valor do aumento e o novo salário.
6. Make a program that receives the base salary (minimum wage/ monthly remuneration) of an employee, calculate and show the salary to receive, knowing that the employee has a bonus (gain more money) of 5% on the base salary and pays 7% tax (interest rate) on this salary.

7. Make a program that receives the base salary (minimum wage/ monthly remuneration) of an employee, calculate and show your salary receivable, knowing that the employee has a bonus of $ 50 (Gained 50 'reais' more. “$” it’s meant “reais”, which represents brazilian Money) and pays (Here, he lost some Money because he need to pay interest rate equal 10%) a 10% tax on the base salary.

8. Make a program that receives the value of a deposit  and the value of the interest rate, calculate and show the value of the yield and the total value after the yield. ##“That’s seems confusing to me. Maybe it’s better to give up this”##. 

9. Make a program that calculates and shows the area of a triangle. It is known that: Area = (base * height) / 2 or   A= b.h/2. 

10. Make a program that calculates and shows the area of a circle. It is known that: Area = π * r2.
